TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

Well since I can't figure out how to import files from a sibling directory,
the best implementation I have come up with is to just copy the menus.py file
into the tests folder every time I want to test something new.

I guess it's not that big of a deal since I am the only developer on this
project.

Maybe one day I will find a better solution.
